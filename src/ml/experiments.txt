1)	Original perceptron classifier: 66.3846% (steady 66% ranges at high iteration #)
	Average perceptron classifier: 76.8041% (steady 76% ranges at high iteration #)
	
2)  We averaged 100 experiments for increasing values of iterations beginning at 1 and ending at 50. 
We noticed a relative peak at around 23 iterations (66.65% accuracy) for the regular perceptron and 
36 iterations (77.02% accuracy) for the average. However, the regular seemed to have cyclical accuracy 
changes as iteration number increased, and the average remained fairly constant throughout.

4) For the normal perceptron, average train time was 3.53e-3 seconds, and test time was 1.40e-4 seconds (n = 100). 
For the average, train time was 3.37e-3 seconds, and test time was 1.7e-4 seconds (n = 100). 
With n = 1000, normal train: .0326s, test: 1.04e-3s, and average train: .0345s, test: 9.1e-4.  

5) One would think the average perceptron would take longer training time, as it does more arithmetic in updating both 
weight arrays and maintains more data. This was true in both of our test runs, but not hugely significant (the extra
array accesses and writes, the most significant difference, likely do not add much in computing time). On the test time,
however, one would expect times to be the same - multiplying feature values by weights to generate a prediction is uniform
between both classifiers. This is generally true within a certain threshold; .00003 sec (n=100) and .0001 sec (n=1000)
differences were observed in our tests.
