1)	Original perceptron classifier: 66.3846%
	Average perceptron classifier: 
	
2)  We averaged 100 experiments for increasing values of iterations beginning at 1 and ending at 100. 
It did not seem as though there was a significant variance in accuracy, but there was a spike in accuracy
at 47 iterations, at 67.1257%. 

3)
